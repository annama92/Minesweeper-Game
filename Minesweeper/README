Installing
- IMPORTANT MODIFICATIONS NEEDED: Modify as1.pro file so that the line RESOURCES += /home/anna/as1/resources.qrc
reflects the correct filepath of the resources.qrc file (currently it is set to my personal user directory on WSL called "anna")
- make sure minesweeper icon png files are in a folder in as1 called minesweeper_icons, otherwise, change file path in resource file as well (resources.qrc)
